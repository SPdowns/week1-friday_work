        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
        <p>Welcome to the part about me, <span class="name">Sean Downs</span>. I come from San Diego. Actually, I was born in Germany, but was only there for maybe 2 or 3 weeks, my father left the service immediatley after. Before coming to Epicodus, I had 3 career paths:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Audio Engineering</li>
          <p>I started recording music in 2003, and started recording others professionally in 2005. I had a professinal grade studio; a live sound package for small groups; and basic musician skills. After two years of barley making money, I switched career paths.
          </p>
          <li>Sketch Comedy Writer</li>
          <p>After falling out of love with recording music, I choose to move to Los Angeles and enter the sketch comedy scene. I tried improv and standup, but sketch comedy is what I truly loved and attempted to break into comedy, professionally, through that path. After almost four years of not moving fast enough, I had to return to San Diego.
          </p>
          <li>Retail</li>
          <P>After all else failed, retail is where I fell down too. Enjoying people, I thought I could feel content with making a living in that kind of profession. Unfortunetly, employees don't make a livable wage, customers aren't considered people, and being treated subhumanly finally took its toll.
          </P>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Which brings us up to date. I chose coding with Epicodus because all the postive changes I've heard occur from people who were able to actually change thier career paths. So, I'm excited about what these new coding skills will bring. But more excited about learning to work with others. And especially excited about Resume and Cover letter training and the mock interviews. If my confidence rises with applying for work, then I know I will have a life that isn't plauged by failing to earn a wage that can support me and a family.</strong>
          </p>
