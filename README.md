#### By _**Sean Downs**_

## Description

_My Live Portfolio Website. This is site's content goes briefly into where I am in the world professionally. This is an exercise in what I've learned at Epicodus the first week._
## Setup/Installation Requirements

_I'd have more to say here if this were an application, but its only a website, so I think it's pretty straight forward_
_To visit the live site; goto https://spdowns.github.io/week1-friday_work/ _

## Known Bugs

_Two main issues I had while building this site were from @media queries and Bootstrap Inheritance_

## Support and contact details

_This is site was built with the limited knowledge gained the first week of Coding Bootcamp. Please feel free to contact me at spdowns@protonmail.com_

## Technologies Used

_This site was built with HTML and CSS. It utilizes HTML tags and CSS design. The sidebar's p tags have some formatting I had to specify, so I'm sure that's not the prettiest; but it works. Uploaded with GitHub and described in README.md with Markdown_
